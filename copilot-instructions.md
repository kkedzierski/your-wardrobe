## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

### Guidelines for STYLING

#### STYLED_COMPONENTS

- Use the ThemeProvider for consistent theming across components
- Implement the css helper for sharing styles between components
- Use props for conditional styling within template literals
- Leverage the createGlobalStyle for global styling
- Implement attrs method to pass HTML attributes to the underlying DOM elements
- Use the as prop for dynamic component rendering
- Leverage styled(Component) syntax for extending existing components
- Implement the css prop for one-off styling needs
- Use the & character for nesting selectors
- Leverage the keyframes helper for animations

### Guidelines for ACCESSIBILITY

#### MOBILE_ACCESSIBILITY

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44 by 44 pixels for comfortable interaction on mobile devices
- Implement proper viewport configuration to support pinch-to-zoom and prevent scaling issues
- Design layouts that adapt to both portrait and landscape orientations without loss of content
- Support both touch and keyboard navigation for hybrid devices with {{input_methods}}
- Ensure interactive elements have sufficient spacing to prevent accidental activation
- Test with mobile screen readers like VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- Design forms that work efficiently with on-screen keyboards and autocomplete functionality
- Implement alternatives to complex gestures that require fine motor control
- Ensure content is accessible when device orientation is locked for users with fixed devices
- Provide alternatives to motion-based interactions for users with vestibular disorders
